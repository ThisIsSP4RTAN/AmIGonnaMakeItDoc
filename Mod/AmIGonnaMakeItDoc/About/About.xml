<description>Provides a prognosis for pawns with immunizable diseases.

Giant malaria outbreak in your colony? Instead of constantly checking the immunity level of your disease ridden pawns to see if they're going to pull through, now you can just quickly check if they're likely to gain immunity based on the current immunity gain rate. 

By default, you'll only see a prognosis if the doctor who did the last tending is at least level 8, but this can be configured in the mod options.</description>
